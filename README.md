```UWG_Standalone_20150119``` is the main repo. The ```UWG_umi_20150226``` is the one with slightly different code for umi (App.xaml.cs has the code with console interface, MainWindow files are different from the other folder because they hide parameters that no longer require separate user inputs because you wrote the code to get info from rhino directly).

These two folders should be merged in the future for ease of maintenance.
