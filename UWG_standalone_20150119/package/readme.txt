URBAN WEATHER GENERATOR 

---------------

1. UWG.exe
UWG.exe has a complete user interface to create the necessary xml file as well as run UWGEngine.exe.

2. UWGEngine.exe
This creates an urban weather file that captures urban heat island effect. It requires two files: (1) epw file and (2) xml file that describes the characteristics of the target and reference site. A sample set of epw and xml files are included in the Example folder.

3. Install Matlab Compiler Runtime 
Pleas verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you have installed version 8.5 (R2015a). MCR allows execution of Matlab-based UWGEngine.exe without fully installing the entire Matlab package on your computer. Please note that you will need administrator rights to run MCRInstaller.
